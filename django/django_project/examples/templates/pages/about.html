              Hope S. Lancaster, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral fellow at Arizona State University in the
              Schools of Engineering and College of Health Solution. Her doctoral training was completed at Vanderbilt
              University under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Camarata. From 2015 to 2017, she was a postdoctoral
              scholar in the Speech and Hearing Science department at Arizona State University and worked on projects
              spanning the genetics of childhood apraxia of speech to the effectiveness of early intervention in
              children with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate. In August 2017, she began working on her research
              funded by her NIH F32 training grant “Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Reading Disorders” under the
              joint mentorship of Drs. Jing Li, Shelley Gray, and Valentin Dinu. Her research examines the shared
              genetic etiology and behavioral symptomology for children with speech sound disorder, developmental
              language disorder, and/or reading disorders and how understanding these shared traits can improve early
              identification and intervention. Dr. Lancaster’s background in psychology, statistics, and communication
              disorders has encouraged her to apply her knowledge of big data and data management to answer
              translational research questions. </p>

              Maria Predtechenskaya is an Arizona State University bachelors student studying Microbiology and Computer
              Science. She hopes to get a PhD in Microbiology and become a professor, studying ways to eradicate chronic
              infections due to biofilms. For this project, she hopes that the database will relieve efforts of many who
              study speech and language disorders.
